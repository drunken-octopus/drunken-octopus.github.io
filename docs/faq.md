# F.A.Q.

## Will *Drunken Octopus* binaries and pre-build configuration files be provided?

To get you started with *Drunken Octopus*, pre-built binaries and configs will be provided for 
the **stock toolhead** for each **standard AlephObjects printer** for free. Patreon supporters
will have access to additional builds.

You can either use the browser based [Drunken Octopus Firmware Tool] to download and upload
firmware to your printer or download a full archive from the [releases page] page on GitHub.

Source code for building everything will always be available to anyone!

## Will using *Drunken Octopus* void my printer warranty?

Probably. If that bothers you, you should stick to factory firmware.

## Will *Drunken Octopus* damage my printer?

He doesn't mean to, but it depends on how much he has had to drink the night before! 
**Use *Drunken Octopus* at your own risk.**

## What if I want my printer to remain sober?

Reach out to [the current owners] and use their firmware. Rumor has it they are still answering the phone.
