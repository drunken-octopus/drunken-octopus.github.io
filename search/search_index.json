This firmware is for users who want the very latest firmware and features for their AlephObjects printers and are willing to take the risks associated with running development firmware . It is also for people who want to modify their AlephObjects printers into custom configurations. Default firmware may not be current or may have certain features turned off for the comfort of new users. On the contrary, Drunken Octopus will charge right ahead, taking it all in, because that is how he likes to roll! Drunken Octopus comes in up to 196 different flavors! If you are savvy with electrical and mechanical things, Drunken Octopus will give you the software to match any hardware upgrades you make to your printer. Head over to the the Drunken Octopus Firmware Tool and Drunken Octopus Wiring Guide to see all the possibilities! Got questions? See the FAQ for answers to the following questions: Will Drunken Octopus binaries and pre-build configuration files be provided? Will using Drunken Octopus void my printer warranty? Will Drunken Octopus damage my printer? What if I want my printer to remain sober? Need more assistance? Drunken Octopus is community supported. Head over to the Forums to get help. How can you help make Drunken Octopus a success? See the contributing page for a list of ways to chip in! License Marlin is published under the GPL license because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork. While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.

Simply follow [this guide] to set up WSL and get yourself an Ubuntu shell, then proceed with the steps for Linux. Linux: Open a shell and execute the following commands one at a time: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install python git make rename sudo apt-get install gcc-avr avr-libc sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi sudo ln -s \"/mnt/c/Users/YOUR_WINDOWS_USER_DIR/Documents\" Documents cd Documents git clone https://github.com/marciot/drunken-octopus-marlin.git marlin cd marlin ./build-configs.sh ./build-firmware.sh Once this process is complete (it may take several hours), the firmware files will be in the build directory of your Documents folder. Arduino IDE: In order to use the Arduino IDE, you will need download and extract the zip file from the [GitHub repo]. The, go into the unpacked folder and replace the \"Configuration.h\" and \"Configuration_adv.h\" files in the \"Marlin\" subdirectory with one of the example configuration files from \"config/examples/AlephObjects\". Drunken Octopus will only include the configuration files for the standard printers and toolheads. Open the \"Marlin.ino\" file from the \"Marlin\" subdirectory in the Arduino IDE. Choose \"Preferences\" from the \"File\" menu and add \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultimachine/ArduinoAddons/master/package_ultimachine_index.json\" to the \"Additional Boards Manager URLs\".
